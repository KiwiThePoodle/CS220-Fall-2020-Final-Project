Our gitlog.txt file is really long with hundreds of commits since we edited our project through github. 

We were rushed for time at the end of the project with debugging so we likely will have memory leakage issues that are unresolved. The game functionality should be fine as long as the user doesn't imput illegal moves.

All members put in a lot of time and worked on the project together.
