Welcome!
========

These Fedora Linux-based Ugrad student workstations are available for your
coursework/class projects.

Information about these systems and all of our CS IT services and resources
can be found on our CS IT Support Wiki at:

                          https://support.cs.jhu.edu

It's a helpful documentation resource, broken up into categories (e.g.
Accounts, Mail, Software, Available Computers, and many more!) providing
information about the details and how-tos of the various computing resources
we make available for your use.

If you experience issues, need assistance, or have questions on any of our IT
services not covered in the wiki, please send email to the CS IT Support Group
at:

                              support@cs.jhu.edu

NOTES:

 * All Ugrad accounts are subject to disk quotas:

 * Please do not run the "sudo" command on our systems.  It is reserved for
   administrative use only.

Thanks!  And good luck with your classes!
